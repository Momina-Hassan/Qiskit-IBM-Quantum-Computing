# Qiskit-IBM-Quantum-Computing
Project from IBM's Qiskit Fall Fest Hackathon 

Imagine youâ€™re in a room with your eyes closed. The light switch is both on and off at the same time ðŸ’¡. But the moment you peek or open your eyes ðŸ‘€, it randomly picks one-either on or off. Until you look, thereâ€™s no way to predict which outcome will occur meaning itâ€™s completely random.

In the study of Quantum Mechanics, this fascinating concept is called Superposition. Which claims that an object can exist in all possible states simulatenously, as long as we dont look to check. An object remains in this superposition until it is measured or observed, at which point it _"collapses"_ into one of its possible states. 

ðŸ’» This principle is the foundation for fields like Quantum Computing where bits can be both 1 or 0. 
At the recent IBM Qiskit Fall Fest, hosted by McMaster's Quantum Computing Club, my team and I explored the principles of superposition and qubits to build a Quantum Random Number Generator. Our developed program generates random winning lottery numbers by utilizing Hadamard gates (H gates) to measure qubits in a superposition state. This project allowed us to apply foundational quantum computing concepts to a practical application in a creative way.
