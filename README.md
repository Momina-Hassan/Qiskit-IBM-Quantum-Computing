# Qiskit-IBM-Quantum-Computing
Project from IBM's Qiskit Fall Fest Hackathon 

I Participated in IBM's Qiskit Fall Fest Quantum Hackathon, hosted by McMaster's Quantum Computing Club.

During the event, my team and I explored principles of quantum bits (qubits) and superposition to develop a Quantum Random Number Generator using Qiskit. 
Our developed program generates random winning lottery numbers by utilizing Hadamard gates (H gates) to measure qubits in a superposition state. 

This project allowed us to apply foundational quantum computing concepts to a practical application in a creative way.
